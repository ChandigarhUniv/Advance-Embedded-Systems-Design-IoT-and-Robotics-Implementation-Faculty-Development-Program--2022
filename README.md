A 3-day FDP course (later extended to 5-Days on demand) on **Embedded Systems and IOT** was organized by **Department of Mechatronics Engineering**, Chandigarh University, Mohali, Punjab, India from 4-8, Jan, 2022. The event started in presence of **Prof. Harjot SIngh Gill**, Associate Director-UIE & Head-Mechatronics, CU; **Prof.Gurmeet Singh**, Academic Co-ordinator-Mechatronics Engineering and Heads of whole Engineering clusters along with their faculties viz., ECE, Aerospace, Automobile and Mechanical engineering departments. Prof. Gill appreciated the efforts of Course coordinator to rope-in our gest speaker **Mr. T. Krishna** from EdGate Technologies Pvt. Ltd. to deliver the hands-on training for the state-of-the-art research facility available at **TEXAS Instruments and Innovation Center of Excellence at Department of Mechatronics Engineering, Chandigarh University   on different integrated optics and photonic technologies.** He further encouraged the faculty for responsible development of products based upon such technologies to meet out the most pressing human and societal needs. Further, **Prof. Pulkit Jain** welcomed all the participants and dignitaries on behalf of the department. He also highlighted the significance of this course in terms of current technology scenario by briefing about course topics as well as highlighting their application scope.
